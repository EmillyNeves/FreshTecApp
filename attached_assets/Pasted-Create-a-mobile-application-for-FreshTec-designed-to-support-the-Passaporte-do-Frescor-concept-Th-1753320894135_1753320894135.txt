Create a mobile application for FreshTec designed to support the "Passaporte do Frescor" concept. The app must enable both B2B (producers, logistics, retailers) and B2C (consumers) functionalities, connecting the food supply chain from farm to table. The app should have a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing design, prioritizing usability, accessibility, and low-cost integration for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Brazil. Use React Native for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android) and Tailwind CSS for styling. Below are the updated requirements for the app's screens and functionalities, including additional monitoring and data features to enhance the scope.

---

### General Requirements

- **Platform**: React Native, ensuring compatibility with iOS and Android.
- **Design**: Clean, modern, and intuitive UI/UX using Tailwind CSS. Use a color palette inspired by freshness (greens, whites, soft blues) with high contrast for accessibility. Ensure responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
- **Language**: Portuguese (Brazil) as the primary language, with clear and concise text.
- **Offline Capability**: Basic functionalities (e.g., viewing cached data, scanning QR codes) should work offline, syncing when connectivity is restored.
- **Security**: Implement secure authentication (email/password or OAuth) and data encryption for sensitive information (e.g., supply chain data).
- **Performance**: Optimize for low-resource devices to ensure accessibility for SMEs and consumers in Brazil.

   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Display real-time data (temperature, humidity, location) for each tracked batch, with alerts for anomalies (e.g., temperature deviation).
   - **Batch Traceability**: Provide a detailed history of each batch (origin, transport conditions, storage conditions) for transparency and quality assurance.
   - **Analytics Dashboard**: Offer insights (e.g., loss trends, transport efficiency) for producers and retailers to optimize operations.
   - **Alert System**: Push notifications and in-app alerts for critical events (e.g., refrigeration failure).
   - **New: Predictive Analytics for Spoilage**: Use machine learning models to predict potential spoilage risks based on historical sensor data (e.g., temperature fluctuations, transit time) and suggest proactive measures (e.g., rerouting to closer markets).
   - **New: Carbon Footprint Tracking**: Calculate and display the carbon footprint of each batch based on transport distance, refrigeration energy use, and spoilage rates, enabling producers and retailers to optimize for sustainability.
   - **New: Compliance Reporting**: Generate automated reports for regulatory compliance (e.g., ANVISA standards in Brazil) based on sensor data, ensuring producers and retailers can provide proof of adherence to food safety regulations.

2. **B2C Features (Consumers)**:

   - **QR Code Scanning**: Enable scanning of QR codes on Selo de Frescor Digital labels to access a food item’s freshness history (origin, transport, storage conditions).
   - **Pote Inteligente Integration**: Allow consumers to pair the app with a smart container (Pote Inteligente) via Bluetooth or QR code to monitor stored food freshness.
   - **Freshness Estimation**: Use algorithms to estimate the remaining shelf life of food items based on sensor data and display notifications (e.g., “Consuma seus tomates nos próximos 2 dias!”).
   - **Visual Freshness Indicator**: Show a visual status (e.g., green/yellow/red) for each food item’s freshness in the app.
   - **Meal Planning**: Suggest recipes or consumption priorities based on food items’ freshness data to reduce waste.
   - **Waste Tracking**: Provide a simple dashboard showing the user’s waste reduction progress (e.g., “Você evitou 2 kg de desperdício este mês!”).
   - **New: Environmental Impact Insights**: Display the environmental impact of reduced waste (e.g., “Você economizou 5 kg de CO2 este mês!”) based on food saved from spoilage.
   - **New: Community Sharing Feature**: Allow consumers to donate near-expiry food to local charities or food banks via the app, with integration to nearby donation points and notifications when food is nearing its shelf life.
   - **New: Storage Optimization Tips**: Provide tailored suggestions for optimal storage conditions (e.g., “Armazene suas maçãs na geladeira a 0-4°C para maior durabilidade”) based on food type and sensor data.

3. **Shared Features**:

   - **Passaporte do Frescor**: Create a unified data trail connecting B2B and B2C, showing the food’s journey (farm → transport → retail → consumer).
   - **Cloud Sync**: Store data in a secure cloud platform, accessible across B2B and B2C users, with real-time updates.
   - **User Roles**: Support different user types (Producer, Transporter, Retailer, Consumer) with role-specific dashboards and permissions.
   - **New: Blockchain-Based Data Integrity**: Implement a blockchain layer to ensure the immutability and trustworthiness of the “Passaporte do Frescor” data, providing a verifiable record of the food’s journey for all stakeholders.
